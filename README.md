Predictive Maintenance Optimization using Reinforcement Learning and RUL Estimation
Description
This project presents an innovative approach to optimize predictive maintenance by combining Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Leveraging the NASA CMAPSS dataset, the objective is to dynamically adapt maintenance strategies, reduce costs, and minimize unexpected failures. The proposed solution utilizes the Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) algorithm enhanced with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) for efficient decision-making in complex environments.
